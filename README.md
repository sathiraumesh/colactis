clocacits
=========

Clocacits is a set of classes that implemented single- and multi-objective versions of Particle Swarm Optimization for Cloudlet scheduling in CloudSim and WSN Localization optimizations. This code is part of a thesis entitled "Optimizing Cloudlet Scheduling and Wireless Sensor Localization using Computational Intelligence Techniques", by Hussein S. Al-Olimat, Submitted to the Graduate Faculty as partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Masters of Science Degree in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Toledo
